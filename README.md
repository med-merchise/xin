# XIN - configuration tools for my desktop system

Xin is a package management and system configuration tool for a Linux-based
workstation.  Xin helps to organize and maintain a workstation installation.

Xin is based on Python, which comes already installed on most Linux
distributions.  If not, you can always ask **"How can I install Python on my
computer?"** to [ChatGPT].

After making sure that Python is installed, the first step is to ensure [pip]
as well:

```sh
python -m ensurepip --user --upgrade
```
